## Building

**Setting Mapbox access token**

To create an access token, you must first create a Mapbox account. The token should have the `Downloads:Read` scope.

-   to download the Android SDK add the token configuration to  `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`  :
```
  SDK_REGISTRY_TOKEN=YOUR_SECRET_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

-   to download the iOS SDK add the token configuration to  `~/.netrc`  :

```
  machine api.mapbox.com
  login mapbox
  password YOUR_SECRET_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

**Setting other secret tokens**

Next, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This file will contain other tokens required for the app. The file should look like this:

    MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=MAPBOX_PUBLIC_TOKEN_HERE
    TRAILBLAZE_APP_TOKEN=APP_SECRET_HERE
    AUTH0_SCHEME=demo
    AUTH0_DOMAIN=trailblaze-dev.us.auth0.com
    AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=SECRET_CLIENT_ID_HERE
    
Note:
- Use your Mapbox public token in this file.
- For the app token, contact trailblaze.team@outlook.com
- The Mapbox access token and the app token are the only required fields to use the basic functionality of the app (Creating routes locally and exploring existing community routes).
- Other fields are only required for accessing your Trailblaze account (saving routes, posting on the community page) and will not be shared to preserve app security.
